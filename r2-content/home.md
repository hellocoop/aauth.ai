# AAuth

## Software Is Changing

Clients used to be written. Now agents assemble them at runtime. The protocols underneath weren't built for that.

- [Protocol Explorer](https://explorer.aauth.dev)

## What Changed

Software used to know at build time what it would call and what it would need. Now agents decide in the moment, against services they've never seen — the old protocols assumed neither.

- **Client IDs Don't Travel** — In OAuth and OIDC, a client has no independent identity — a `client_id` at Google is meaningless at GitHub. Agents have no identity of their own to carry between services.
- **Copied Secrets Leak** — API keys are a shared secret issued by the service and copied to the client. Any secret copied to a workload will eventually leak somewhere it shouldn't.
- **Decisions Happen Mid-Task** — Agents need authorization decisions mid-task. Consent lands on human timelines — and today's protocols treat pending as an error, not a first-class state.
- **Tool Chains Assemble Live** — Agents pick their tool chain at runtime, one call at a time. The sequence isn't declared in code — they choose the next tool as the task unfolds, and the chain shifts with every task.
- **Scopes Don't Capture Intent** — A scope is standing permission, not per-call intent. `mail.read` looks the same whether the agent is summarizing or scraping — policy can't tell them apart.
- **Calls Cross Trust Domains** — A single task can span orgs, clouds, and identity domains. Workload identity (SPIFFE) stops at the trust-domain edge — and authority stops there too.

## Why AAuth?

*By [Dick Hardt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dickhardt), author of OAuth 2.0*

After implementing authorization for our MCP server, I concluded [OAuth is not a good fit for MCP](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358178115673616384/) and started working with others in the identity community who'd hit the same walls.

AAuth is what came out of that work. It gives every HTTP client its own cryptographic identity and carries identity claims and authorization claims in the same token. It coexists with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect rather than replacing them.

The web gave servers identity. It's time clients got the same.

## How AAuth Works

AAuth has four access modes. The simplest replaces API keys; each adds parties and capabilities. Adopt any mode independently.

| Mode | Parties | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Identity-Based | Agent + Resource | Agent signs every request. Resource verifies identity and applies its own access control. Replaces API keys. |
| Resource-Managed | Agent + Resource | Resource handles authorization itself — via user interaction, consent, or an existing OAuth / OIDC provider. |
| Person Server (PS) Managed | Agent + Resource + PS | Access is brokered by a server representing the user — the Person Server (PS). It handles consent and issues the auth token; the resource stays focused on its API. |
| Federated | Agent + Resource + PS + Access Server (AS) | Internet-scale mode for cross-organization access. Resource has its own Access Server (AS); PS federates with AS across trust domains to obtain the auth token. |

### Identity-Based

```
Agent  → Resource:  HTTPSig w/ agent_token
Agent  ← Resource:  200 OK
```

### Resource-Managed

```
Agent  → Resource:  HTTPSig w/ agent_token
Agent  ← Resource:  202 (interaction required)
                    [user completes interaction]
Agent  → Resource:  GET pending URL
Agent  ← Resource:  200 OK, AAuth-Access: opaque-token
Agent  → Resource:  HTTPSig w/ agent_token, Authorization: AAuth opaque-token
Agent  ← Resource:  200 OK
```

### Person Server (PS) Managed

```
Agent  → Resource:  HTTPSig w/ agent_token, POST /authorize
Agent  ← Resource:  resource_token (aud = PS URL)
Agent  → PS:        HTTPSig w/ agent_token, POST /token w/ resource_token
Agent  ← PS:        auth_token
Agent  → Resource:  HTTPSig w/ auth_token, GET /api/documents
Agent  ← Resource:  200 OK
```

### Federated

```
Agent  → Resource:  HTTPSig w/ agent_token, POST /authorize
Agent  ← Resource:  resource_token (aud = AS URL)
Agent  → PS:        HTTPSig w/ agent_token, POST /token w/ resource_token
PS     → AS:        HTTPSig w/ jwks_uri, POST /token w/ resource_token
PS     ← AS:        auth_token
Agent  ← PS:        auth_token
Agent  → Resource:  HTTPSig w/ auth_token, GET /api/documents
Agent  ← Resource:  200 OK
```

Token glossary:

- `agent_token` establishes the agent's identity
- `resource_token` describes the access needed
- `auth_token` grants an agent access to a resource
- `jwks_uri` Person Server (PS)'s JWKS endpoint, discovered via well-known metadata

## Explore AAuth

Try the protocol, explore the SDKs, and follow the conversation. The demos and Playground run against the Hellō Beta Person Server — data is reset regularly, so don't store anything you need to keep.
